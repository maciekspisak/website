# My personal website
## About
Over the last few years I wrote some code now and then. This (2023) year I have decided to put more effort into development of my programming skills. Always wanted to gain some knowledge regarding JavaScript. So that is about to be the project I start with. **Dashboard** which is the first (and hopefully not the last) feature is supposed to display my effort to the public.

As long as it is about small personal projects, I fully agree with the statement on [Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/) website:
>Life's too short, let's get back to coding.
